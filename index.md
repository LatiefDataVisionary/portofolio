> My mission is to translate raw, complex data into intelligent, actionable solutions that drive growth and solve real-world problems. I build, not just analyze.

As a final-year Data Science honours student with a **3.95 GPA**, my academic foundation is solid, but my true passion lies in the practical application of technology. I thrive on the entire project lifecycle: from defining a problem and engineering a robust data pipeline, to developing predictive models and deploying cutting-edge Generative AI systems. I believe in **end-to-end ownership** and pragmatic innovation.

### My Philosophy

*   **Data as a Language:** I treat data not just as numbers, but as a language that tells a story. My goal is to become fluent in that language to uncover narratives that others might miss.
*   **Models as Tools, Not Oracles:** I build machine learning models as powerful tools to solve specific problems, rigorously testing and evaluating them to understand their strengths and limitations.
*   **Pragmatic Innovation:** I am deeply fascinated by the frontier of AI, especially LLMs. I focus on applying these powerful technologies to create tangible business value, not just for the sake of novelty.

### Case Studies: From Concept to Code

Here are a few projects where I transformed an idea into a functional data-driven solution.

---

### 1. AI-Powered Counterfeit Detection & Risk Summarization
*Keywords: Generative AI, LLM Integration, Machine Learning, E-commerce Trust & Safety*

This system addresses a critical e-commerce challenge: identifying fraudulent product listings and communicating the risk effectively. It's a hybrid AI solution that combines the predictive power of classical ML with the summarization capabilities of modern LLMs.

*   **Impact:** Creates a scalable system to enhance platform trust by automating fraud detection and accelerating human-in-the-loop review processes with AI-generated summaries.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, **Large Language Models (IBM Granite)**.
